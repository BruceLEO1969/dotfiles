# Iterm Keys customizations

First we need to send super-enter without going into full screen
 Add the following shortcuts (in global settings, not the profile keys)
 shift-enter => send text "✠"
 command-enter => esc sequence "[24;2~"

Under the profile make sure that left alt is sending normal.
  that allows the default alt-r (unicode ®) chars to be mapped in vim.
Then we need the command and alt keys to send the correct keys
