# VIM customizations


## ALT key shortcuts
Mac and VIM doesn't play well with alt-key shortcuts. To VIM they just look like extended character keys, there doesn't seem to be any indication of an alt-key modifier.

The following alt level shortcuts have been defined

`alt-r` i.e. ® => recent files
`alt-p` i.e. π => project level files
`alt-f` i.e. ƒ => file level tags
`alt-t` i.e. † => buffer files
`alt-]` i.e. ‘ => visual tjump (tag jump plugin)
